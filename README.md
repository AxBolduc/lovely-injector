# Lovely is a runtime lua injector for LÃ–VE 2d

Lovely is a lua injector which embeds code into the game process at runtime. This is accomplished without ever needing to mutate the game's executable as no unpacking and repacking is required. This ensures that mods can be easily upgrade and uninstalled without needing to reinstall the game.

## Patches

*Note that the patch format is unstable and prone to change until Lovely is stable.*

*Patch files* define where and how code injection occurs within the game process. For example, this is a patch for the modloader Steamodded:

```toml
[manifest]
version = "1.0.0"
dump_lua = true
priority = 0

[[patches]]
[patches.pattern]
target = "game.lua"
pattern = "self.SPEEDFACTOR = 1"
position = "after"
payload = "initSteamodded()"
match_indent = true
overwrite = false

[[patches]]
[patches.copy]
target = "main.lua"
position = "append"
sources = [
    "core/core.lua",
    "core/deck.lua",
    "core/joker.lua",
    "core/sprite.lua",
    "debug/debug.lua",
    "loader/loader.lua",
]
```
### Patch variants 

This file contains two patch definitions - a pattern patch, which (currently) changes a single line at a position offset to some pattern match, and a copy patch, which reads one or more input lua files and either appends or prepends them onto the target. The former is used when you need to surgically embed code at specific locations in the target (very useful for modloader init routines), and the latter is designed for use when you need to bulk inject position-independent code into the game.

### Patch files

Patch files are loaded from mod directories inside of `AppData/Balatro/Mods`. Lovely will load any patch files present within `Mods/ModName/lovely/` or load a single patch from `Mods/ModName/lovely.toml`. If multiple patches are loaded they will be injected into the game in the order in which they are found.

Paths defined within the patch are rooted by the mod's directory. For example, `core/deck.lua` is resolved to `AppData/Balatro/Steamodded/core/deck.lua`.

### Patch targets

Each patch definition has a single patch target. These targets are the relative paths of source files when dumped from the game with a tool like 7zip. For example, I can target a top-level file like `main.lua`, or one in a subdirectory like `engine/event.lua`.

## Not yet implemented

- `manifest.priority`
- `manifest.dump_lua`
- `manifest.version`

## User installation

1. Download the latest release.
2. Open the .zip archive, copy `dwmapi.dll` into the game directory. You can navigate to the location by right-clicking the game in Steam, hovering "Manage", and selecting "Browse local files".
3. Install one or more mods into `%appdata%/Balatro/Mods`.
4. Run the game.
